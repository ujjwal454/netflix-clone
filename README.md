The Netflix Clone project is a web application that replicates the features and functionalities of the popular streaming platform Netflix. This project is built using React, which is a widely used JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and integrates the TMDB API for fetching data about movies and TV shows.

The application also uses Firebase for user authentication and storing user data such as their favorite shows and movies. Firebase is a cloud-based platform that provides various backend services, including authentication, database storage, and hosting.

React-query is used for managing data fetching and caching in the application. It simplifies the process of fetching data by abstracting away the complexity of managing asynchronous data and provides a simple and intuitive interface for making API requests.

Overall, this project aims to provide a user-friendly and visually appealing interface for browsing movies and TV shows, and storing favorite content. With the integration of TMDB API, Firebase, and React-query, this application provides a seamless and efficient user experience for managing entertainment content.

In addition to using the TMDB API, Firebase, and React-query, this Netflix Clone project is hosted on Netlify. Netlify is a cloud-based platform that provides hosting, deployment, and other services for web applications.
